PBL Accomplishments:

(1) Quotes Database
This is a database that I created that store quotes, authors, and topics for different inspiration quotes. This feature is on the homepage of our website and meant to draw users into our website. For each quote there is a GET request of a random element from the data. 

(2) Person Database
This is another database that stores users of our website and information abuot them. It is build from a GET from the backend to fetch the information from each person including their pros and cons about them. This was built into an HTML table 

(3) Cards for Person
Similar to the Quotes, I built a frontend display of the data from the backend which is another GET request from the backend. It once agaiin GETs a random id frmo the database and displays the information about that specific person. This was formatted with CSS and builting into an HTML table.

(4) Create, Update, and Delete
I built a form for the create in our person which includes basic information about them with additional information like traits about them and their pros and cons about themselves. Only the admin account is able to update their information and delete information. Since there is one update profile page and one delete account page, the functions linked to the buttons on the page must be able to identify the admin logged in, in order to update or delete the correct people.
