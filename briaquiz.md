| Question # | Topic | Skills | My Answer | Correct Answer | Explanation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 8.2 | 4.B | B | C | My answer was incorrect because the syntax for traversing an array list was wrong. Instead of doing the for loop for the columns and then the rows, I did the for loop for the columns only. I needed to include the rows because it was a two-dimensional array. This question tells me that I need to get better are memorizing syntax for Arraylists.  |
| 17 | 4.3 | 4.C | C | D | My answer was incorrect because I did not count the amount of a after not bs properly. I understood that the algorithm was meant to count the amount of times in the phrase that a was not followed by b. However I did not count them correctly. This was not a conceptual error, so there is not anything for me to review from this question.   |
| 20 | 4.2 | 4.C | D | E | On this problem, I did not think through the for loop and what would e printed at each step. This was just an error of me not thoroughly looking at each line of the code. I don't think that I need to review this concept, but I do need to spread more time on each problem.  |
| 32 | 6.4 | 4.B | C | E | This program was meant to find the longest block of values that are next to each other in an array. I needed to look at each line of the code better because the location that I put the count was too high. In the location that I put it, the program would've reset the counter before each length was added to maxLen which is not correct.  |
| 44 | 2.2, 5.8 | 4.B | C | D | The variables n1 and n2 were never defined in the class. For some reason I thought that when it was in the parameter of the function, it is enough to define it. This is not true. I can get better as this by experimenting with writing functions with different variables used as parameters.  |
| 55 | 3.6 | 4.C | A | C | I initially had this option selected, but I thought that it was or not an and, so I changed my answer. I think I have been getting better with DeMorgan's law which is good.  |
| 56 | 7.4 | 4.B | D | E | This question was difficult because I did not understand what was wrong about the class, so I selected a random option. However, if the else was not added before the line with k++, then the array would not properly go through each element in the array. It would skip through every other item in the list. I think I can get better at this topic by making sure that I understand each line of the algorithm and thinking about the effect that each answer choice will have on the class.  |
| 61 | 9.5 | 4.B | C | D | For this question, I genuinely did not understand which was incorrect. I did not understand the method declarations, and I need to go back and review constructors for objects more.  |
| 63 | 6.2 | 4.B | E | C | The answer I chose is incorrect because if the lines were removed from the code then it would store the smaller of each pair of values in the array instead of the largest.  |
| 65 | 3.4 | 4.A | B | E | This question had me confused because of all the ifs and elseifs. I wasn't sure where the error was because of this. To review this I would need to go back and look at more examples of if, else, and elseif statements.  |

Reflection: <br>
**Area of Strength: 4.A** These are the questions where, it gives you specific test cases to see if it causes the code to break or not. These questions are better for me because they do not require a lot of analysis of each line of code. Additionally, its easy to test each option and compare the results of each call to the function. <br><br><br>
**Area for Improvement: 4.B** Doing this quiz has shown me that I need to get stronger at skill 4.B. This is being able to identify errors in code. A lot of this quix was looking for errors, and I think it was a struggle for me because I had to look through each answer choice and see if it was the error. Additionally, this required me to look at every single line of the code and try to understand what it means. This quiz lets me know that I have to be more detailed at looking through each line and understanding what it does. I would considered this a weaker area because it requires more time and I have to be more careful and look through each parts of the code. Also most of the time, the answer choices are so similar that I will have the right idea and just not select the right answer. 
<br><br>**4.C.** These questions are when you have to compare two different algorimns and check if they give the same result. These questions are more difficult because you have look at two different sets of code which is a lot more time consuming. This shows me that I need to take more time when going through each answer, and focus on the differences in the two option.
